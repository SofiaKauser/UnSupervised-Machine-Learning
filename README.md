# Myopia Clusters

In this project use unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, create a visualization that shares findings. 

### Finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. 

To improve classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, I decided to explore the possibility by using unsupervised learning.


### This project is broken down into four parts:

Part 1: Prepare the Data

Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction

Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

Part 4: Make a Recommendation

### Prepare the Data
